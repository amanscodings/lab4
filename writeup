My approach for this lab was to use defintion provided by professor. I created statements that 
would check the tree. Then i listed the original tree and then the approach i used in code was to invert
and balance the tree


for lab 5, my approach was to use defintion provided professor. Then I listed the tree node that would
check if its balanced and its right or not.
